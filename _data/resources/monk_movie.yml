  This [documentary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thelonious_Monk:_Straight,_No_Chaser), which can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mAPMJWpeY3U), features live performances and posthumous interviews with Monk's friends and family. Lots of the clips show Monk's interesting and idiosyncratic communication style, both on and off the stage.
