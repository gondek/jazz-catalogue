title: The All Music Guide to Jazz
content: >-
  Although [AllMusic's website](http://www.allmusic.com/) is an excellent resource for all types of music, and far surpasses the amount of information that could be kept in a book, it is nice to have a physical copy of the [All Music Guide to Jazz](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/613909.All_Music_Guide_to_Jazz) to browse through. Aside from reviews of 18,000 albums, it also has some essays on jazz history and genres, artist biographies, and book recommendations.
