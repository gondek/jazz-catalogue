title: 'Jazz: A Film by Ken Burns'
content: >-
  Running at over 1000 minutes, [this 10-part documentary series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%28TV_series%29) contains tons of information and interesting stories. Although its treatment of post-50s material is somewhat unbalanced, it does a great job covering the beginnings of jazz up through the start of bebop. It's a bit of a time investment, but I definitely think it's worth the watch.
