title: 'The Niven Collection of Early Jazz Legends'
content: >-
  This [massive collection](https://archive.org/details/davidwnivenjazz&tab=about) of music and commentary was put together by David W. Niven, a high school teacher from New Jersey. All 1000 hours+ of content is available for free. Unfortunately, the format of the collection is not the easiest to browse through, so I have not taken advantage of it much. However, even from the limited sampling I have done, I found David's knowledge of jazz and the breadth of this collection astounding.
