  Very raw, unapologetic, and lots of fun, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829313.Miles">Miles' Autobiography</a> had me laughing out loud within the first few pages (drawing curious glances from my fellow passengers when I was reading it on the bus). Aside from Miles' interesting opinions on jazz music (both his own and that of others), Miles has lots of highly personal anecdotes about his time spent with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and other musicians.
