title: 'Miles: The Autobiography'

  Very raw, opinionated, and lots of fun, [Miles' Autobiography](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829313.Miles) had me laughing out loud within the first few pages. Aside from Miles' *interesting* opinions on jazz music (both his own and that of others), Miles talks candidly about his personal struggles and shares anecdotes about his time spent with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, and other musicians.
