  Running at over 1000 minutes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%28TV_series%29">this 10-part documentary series</a> contains tons of information and interesting stories. Although it's treatment of post-50s material is somewhat unbalanced, it does a great job covering the beginnings of jazz up through the start of bebop. It's a bit of a time investment, but I definitely think it's worth it.
