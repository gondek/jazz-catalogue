I"ó<p>Although <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/">AllMusicâ€™s website</a> is an excellent resource for all types of music, and far surpasses the amount of information that could be kept in a book, it is nice to have a physical copy of the <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/613909.All_Music_Guide_to_Jazz">All Music Guide to Jazz</a> to browse through. Aside from reviews of 18,000 albums, it also has some essays on jazz history and genres, artist biographies, and book recommendations.</p>
