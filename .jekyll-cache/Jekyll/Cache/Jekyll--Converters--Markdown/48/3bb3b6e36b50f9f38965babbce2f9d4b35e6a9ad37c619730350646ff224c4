I"¥<p>Running at over 1000 minutes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%28TV_series%29">this 10-part documentary series</a> contains tons of information and interesting stories. Although its treatment of post-50s material is somewhat unbalanced, it does a great job covering the beginnings of jazz up through the start of bebop. Itâ€™s a bit of a time investment, but I definitely think itâ€™s worth the watch.</p>
