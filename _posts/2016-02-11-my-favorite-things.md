Coltrane's completely different take on the title track, "My Favorite Things" from "The Sound of Music", is amazing. It changes the joyous and light-hearted song into something that is hypnotic, haunting, and almost sad, but still hopeful. Coltrane also has a unique approach to the rest of the songs on this album, which are also jazz versions of pop standards. For example, his interpretation of "Summertime" is quite different from Miles Davis' on "Porgy and Bess".
