One of my all-time favorite albums, Ah Um covers a lot of styles and moods and is a great way to get into Mingus. I particularly enjoy "Better Git It in Your Soul", which was inspired by gospel singing and preaching (you can hear Mingus shouting throughout the song, encouraging the musicians and really getting into the tune). Two other songs that stand out for me are "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" (an elegy for saxophonist Lester Young), and "Open Letter to Duke" (a tribute to Duke Ellington which is mixture of several of Mingus' earlier works).
