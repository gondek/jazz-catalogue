quote: "I began to feel that I had been spending so much time exploring the upper atmosphere of music and the more ethereal kind of far-out spacey stuff. Now there was this need to take some more of the earth and to feel a little more tethered; a connection to the earth..."

Although Herbie Hancock was not the first to explore a transition towards electronic and funk jazz, this album became a huge milestone in those genres. The bassline on the opening track, Chameleon, is well known for its groove (it has been sampled a large amount of times in other songs). Another fun part of the album is the completely new take on Hancock's jazz standard composition, Watermelon Man.

Strangely enough, despite Hancock wanting this album to be more grounded, listeners couldn't completely let go of the "ethereal" mood the album evoked. However, one particular magazine advertisement came up with a bit of a compromise between the two, calling this "...a record that is guaranteed to take your head farther into outer space. And your body one step closer to home."
