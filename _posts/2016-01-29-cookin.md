This album is part of a group of 4 (the others being [Relaxin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relaxin'_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet), [Steamin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steamin'_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet), [Workin'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Workin'_with_the_Miles_Davis_Quintet)) that were recorded in two days (May 11 and October 26, 1956) by Miles' "First Great Quintet". It's amazing how so much great music can be recorded in so little time, a testament to the ability of the group and the tightness between its members.
