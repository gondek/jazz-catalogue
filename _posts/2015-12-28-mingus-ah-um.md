One of my all-time favorite albums, Ah Um covers a lot of styles and moods and is a great way to get into Mingus. I particularly enjoy "Better Git It in Your Soul", which was inspired by gospel singing and preaching (you can hear Mingus shouting in the background). Two other songs that stand out for me are "Goodbye Pork Pie Hat" (an elegy for saxophonist Lester Young), and "Open Letter to Duke". However, I could just as easily recommend any other song on this album - I love them all!
