Cowboy Bebop is a very popular [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop) which has received critical acclaim for its character design, art, voice acting, style, thematic elements, and of course, music. The (first) soundtrack album is largely jazz-based, but also contains some country and blues songs. Be sure to listen to the [additional soundtrack albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Cowboy_Bebop) if you like the mixture of styles or if you liked the show. Some songs I would strongly recommend are: "Tank!" (the opening theme song), "Bad Dog No Biscuits" (intense ska jazz), "Space Lion" ("space-blues" &amp; tribal fusion), and "Car24" (a light hearted tune).

Also check out this [live Seatbelts performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GywG4NFado), which is very intense and a lot of fun, but perhaps a little bit overdone? Watch it and decide for yourself!
