With no disrespect to the fans of the critically acclaimed [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop), I could imagine a situation where the music for Cowboy Bebop was written first, and then the show was put together after the fact. The (first) album is largely jazz-based, but also contains some country and blues influenced numbers. Some of my personal favorites are 3 high-paced songs: "Tank!", "Rush", "Bad Dog No Biscuits", a slower "spacey" number: "Space Lion", and the really light and playful "Car 24" and "Cat Blues".

Be sure to check out the [further soundtrack albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Cowboy_Bebop) if you liked the mixture of styles or if you liked the show.

There's also a [live Seatbelts performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GywG4NFado) of some songs, which is very intense and a lot of fun, but perhaps a little bit overdone? Watch it and decide for yourself!
