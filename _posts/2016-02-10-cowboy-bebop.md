With no disrespect to the fans of the critically acclaimed [anime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cowboy_Bebop), I could imagine a situation where the music for Cowboy Bebop was written first, and then the show was put together after the fact - the music is *that* good. The (first) album is largely jazz-based, but also contains some country and blues songs. Be sure to listen to the [additional soundtrack albums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_of_Cowboy_Bebop) if you liked the mixture of styles or if you liked the show.

Also check out this [live Seatbelts performance](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GywG4NFado), which is very intense and a lot of fun, but perhaps a little bit overdone? Watch it and decide for yourself!
