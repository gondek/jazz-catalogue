I had a hard time listening to TBSATSL at first because of its intense solos, rhythms, tempo and unconventional melodies. But now I love sitting down, closing my eyes, and listening to it from beginning to end without any distractions. Mingus, who wrote it partially as a ballet, called the style "ethnic folk-dance music" and noted his in the liner notes that listeners could "throw all other records of [his] away". The liner notes give some interesting background to the album, because in additional to Mingus' lengthly (rambling) commentary on the album and music community, his psychologist writes the album and track summaries (Mingus wrote TBSATSL while he was undergoing psychotherapy).
