I had a hard time listening to TBSATSL at first because it can be quite jarring with its intense solos, rhythms, tempo and unique structure (Mingus wrote it partially as a ballet). But now I cannot help but sit down, close my eyes, and listen to it from beginning to end without any distractions. It ends up being quite the musical and mental journey! Something that may not surprise some listeners is that Mingus wrote it while he was undergoing psychotherapy (in fact, his psychologist wrote some of the liner notes).
