I had a hard time listening to this at first because it can be quite jarring with its intense solos, rhythms and tempo. But now it now one of the few albums that I will listen to from beginning to end without directing my attention to anything else, because it ends up consuming all of my attention. Mingus wrote it partially as a ballet and while he was undergoing psychotherapy, something that may not surprise some listeners. I often use this album as fuel for introspection or simply clearing my mind.
