An amazing work of composition, performance and editing. I had a hard time listening to it at first - it can be quite jarring - but once I took the time to listen closely and approached it as a single multi-part narrative, I was blown away by this album. Mingus wrote it partially as a ballet and while he was undergoing psychotherapy, something that may not surprise some listeners. I can use this album to pump me up or lull me to sleep (as strange as that seems).
