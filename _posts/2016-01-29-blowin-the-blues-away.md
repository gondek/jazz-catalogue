This album definitely lives up to its name! It has some really amazing interplay between soloists, along with some intense piano work by Silver. The album alternates between fast "high-caloric" songs, and slower, more contemplative work, and is the debut of Silver's composition, "Sister Sadie", a jazz standard.
