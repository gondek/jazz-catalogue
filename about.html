    <h2>About the Catalogue</h2>

    <p>Originally when asked for jazz recommendations, I would send people a long list of youtube links. It eventually became unwieldy, so I organized it into this website.</p>

    <p>All the albums listed here are ones that I keep in my library. If an album is not here, I either have not listened to it, or I did not feel like adding it to my library.</p>

    <p>I am always looking to broaden my musical horizons, so I would be glad to hear your listening suggestions. Feel free to contact me through my <a href="{{ site.alex_url }}">main website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Omissions</h2>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of jazz is improvisation, so attending live events is a must for jazz fans. That being said, I don't go to as many as I would like to, and there's nothing wrong with having your own collection of favorite albums!</p>

    <p>My jazz library has a lack of various periods and sub-genres, including early jazz (eg. pre-30s, ragtime, New Orleans, dixieland), vocal jazz, post-60s jazz (eg. avant-garde, free jazz, fusion) and modern/active musicians.</p>

        <h3>Jazz: A Film by Ken Burns</h3>
        Running at over 1000 minutes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%28TV_series%29">this 10-part documentary series</a> contains tons of information and interesting stories. Although it's treatment of post-50s material is somewhat unbalanced, it does a great job covering the beginnings of jazz up through the start of bebop. It's a bit of a time investment, but I definitely think it's worth it.

          <h3>Miles: The Autobiography</h3>
          Very raw, opinionated, and lots of fun, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829313.Miles">Miles' Autobiography</a> had me laughing out loud within the first few pages. Aside from Miles' interesting opinions on jazz music (both his own and that of others), Miles talks candidly about his personal struggles and shares anecdotes about his time spent with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, and other musicians.
