    <h2>About the Catalogue</h2>

    <p>Originally when asked for jazz recommendations, I would send people a long list of youtube links. It eventually became unwieldy, so I organized it into this website. For the full list in plain text, along with any other (non-jazz) albums in my music collection, <a href="{{ prepend: site.baseurl }}/list.txt">click here</a>.</p>

    <p>I am always looking to broaden my musical horizons, so I would be glad to hear your listening suggestions. Feel free to contact me through my <a href="{{ site.alex_url }}">main website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Omissions</h2>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of jazz is improvisation, so attending live events is a must for jazz fans. That being said, I don't go to as many as I would like to, and there's nothing wrong with having your own collection of favorite albums!</p>

    <p>My jazz library has a lack of various periods and sub-genres, including early jazz (eg. pre-30s, ragtime, New Orleans, dixieland), vocal jazz, post-60s jazz (eg. avant-garde, free jazz, fusion) and modern/active musicians.</p>

<h2>Performances Videos of Interest</h2>

<p>Searching Youtube can pull up lots of jazz videos, but often some really interesting ones get buried in the mix. Here are some that I think are worth watching:

<ul class="video-links">
  {% for video in site.data.videos %}
  <li><a href="{{ video.link }}">{{ video.title }}:</a> {{ video.description }}</li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>
