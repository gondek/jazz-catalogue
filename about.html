    <h2>About the Catalogue</h2>

    <p>Originally when asked for jazz recommendations, I would send people a long list of youtube links. It eventually became unwieldy, so I organized it into this website. For the full list in plain text, along with any other (non-jazz) albums in my music collection, <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/list.txt">click here</a>.</p>

    <p><img class="pick" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/css/pick.png" alt="Alex's Picks">&nbsp; Albums with this symbol are ones that I really engage with. Whether it be their ability to evoke many different emotions or that they lay down a really juicy melody or groovy beat, listening to them is always an especially rewarding experience for me. However, some of them might be difficult to listen to for jazz newcomers. Also, albums that lack this symbol are not any less enjoyable. After all, they are all part of my catalogue!</p>

    <p>I am always looking to broaden my musical horizons, so I would be glad to hear your listening suggestions. Feel free to contact me through my <a href="{{ site.alex_url }}">main website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Omissions</h2>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of jazz is improvisation, so attending live events is a must for jazz fans. That being said, I don't go to as many as I would like to, and there's nothing wrong with having your own collection of favorite albums!</p>

    <p>My jazz library has a lack of various periods and sub-genres, including early jazz (eg. pre-30s, ragtime, New Orleans, dixieland), vocal jazz, post-70s jazz (eg. avant-garde, free jazz, fusion) and modern/active musicians.</p>
