    <h2>About the Catalogue</h2>

    <p>The primary reason I created this catalogue was to share the music I like with others. Originally when asked by others for some jazz suggestions, I would send them a long list of youtube links with a few rambling descriptions. It eventually became unwieldy, so I decided to clean it up, rewrite my comments, and turn in into this website.</p>

    <p>I am always looking to broaden my musical horizons, so I would be glad to hear your listening suggestions and feedback on the site. Feel free to contact me through my <a href="http://alex.gondek.ca">main website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Omissions</h2>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of jazz is improvisation, so attending live events is a must for jazz fans. That being said, I don't go to as many as I would like to, and there's nothing wrong with having your own collection of favorite albums!</p>

    <p>This catalogue glosses over many eras, artists and sub-genres of jazz, including early jazz (eg. pre-30s, ragtime, New Orleans, dixieland), vocal jazz, and post-60s jazz (eg. avant-garde, free jazz, fusion) and modern/active musicians.</p>

<h2>Additional Media and Resources</h2>
<div class="row resources">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <ul>

      <li><span>Reddit</span> The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/">Jazz Subreddit</a> is a great place to find modern material, interesting stories from jazz history, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Jazz/comments/llym8/a_poll_for_essential_jazz_albums/">more recommendations</a> from various decades.</li>

      <li><span>Jazz: A Film by Ken Burns</span> Running at over 1000 minutes, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jazz_%28TV_series%29">this 10-part documentary series</a> contains tons of information and interesting stories. Although it's treatment of post-50s material is somewhat unbalanced, it does a great job covering the beginnings of jazz up through the start of bebop. It's a bit of a time investment, but I definitely think it's worth it.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><span>Miles: The Autobiography</span> Very raw, opinionated, and lots of fun, <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/829313.Miles">Miles' Autobiography</a> had me laughing out loud within the first few pages (drawing curious glances from my fellow passengers when I was reading it on the bus). Aside from Miles' interesting opinions on jazz music (both his own and that of others), Miles talks candidly about his personal struggles and shares anecdotes about his time spent with Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Herbie Hancock, and other musicians.</li>
