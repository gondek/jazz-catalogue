    <h2>Notes and Omissions</h2>
    <p>A quintessential characteristic of jazz is improvisation, so attending live events is a must for jazz fans. That being said, I don't go to as many as I would like to, and there's nothing wrong with having your own collection of favorite albums!</p>

    <p>This is by no means a comprehensive list that touches all the eras, artists and sub-genres of jazz. As fun as that would be, it would be nearly impossible to put together and would be overwhelming to go through. Since there is so much to discover, I would recommend following your interests and research artists and albums similar to the ones you like. Be sure to check out my <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources">resources page</a> for some starting points.</p>

    <p>Some areas that I am not very interested in and that my catalogue generally omits are: early jazz (eg. pre-30s, ragtime, New Orleans, dixieland), vocal jazz, and post-60s jazz (eg. avant-garde, free jazz, fusion).</p>
