    <h2>About the Catalogue</h2>

    <p>The primary reason I created this catalogue was to share the music I love with others. Originally when asked by others for some jazz suggestions, I would send them a long list of youtube links with a few rambling descriptions. It eventually became unwieldy, so I decided to clean it up, rewrite my comments, and turn in into this website.</p>

    <p>I am always looking to broaden my musical horizons, so I would be glad to hear your listening suggestions and feedback on the site. Feel free to contact me through my <a href="http://alex.gondek.ca">main website</a>.</p>

    <h2>Notes and Omissions</h2>
    <p>A fundamental characteristic of jazz is improvisation, so attending live events is a must for jazz fans. That being said, I don't go to as many as I would like to, and there's nothing wrong with having your own collection of favorite albums!</p>

    <p>This catalogue glosses over many eras, artists and sub-genres of jazz, including early jazz (eg. pre-30s, ragtime, New Orleans, dixieland), vocal jazz, and post-60s jazz (eg. avant-garde, free jazz, fusion) and modern/active musicians. Since there is so much to discover, I would recommend following your interests and research artists and albums similar to the ones you like. Check out my <a href="/resources">resources page</a> for some starting points.</p>
